Yeah, you can be the greatest<br>
You can be the best<br>
You can be the King Kong banging on your chest<br>
<br>
You can beat the world<br>
You can beat the war<br>
You can talk to God, go banging on his door<br>
<br>
You can throw your hands up<br>
You can beat the clock (yeah)<br>
You can move a mountain<br>
You can break rocks<br>
You can be a master<br>
Don't wait for luck<br>
Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself<br>

Standing in the hall of fame (yeah)<br>
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)<br>
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)<br>
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)<br>
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame<br>

You can go the distance<br>
You can run the mile<br>
You can walk straight through hell with a smile<br>

You can be the hero<br>
You can get the gold<br>
Breaking all the records they thought never could be broke<br>
<br>
Yeah, do it for your people<br>
Do it for your pride<br>
How are you ever gonna know if you never even try?<br>
<br>
Do it for your country<br>
Do it for your name<br>
'Cause there's gonna be a day...<br>
<br>
When you're standing in the hall of fame (yeah)<br>
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)<br>
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)<br>
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)<br>
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame<br>
<br>
Be a champion, be a champion, be a champion, be a champion<br>
On the walls of the hall of fame<br>

Be students<br>
